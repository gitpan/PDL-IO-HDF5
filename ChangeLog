2010-04-27 20:31  cerney

	* README, hdf5.pd: Preparation for release of 0.6

2010-04-27 20:29  cerney

	* Makefile.PL: Updated Makefile.PL for better compatibility with
	CPAN in its check for PDL installation and hdf5 libraries

2010-04-27 18:25  cerney

	* t/attribPDL.t: Test case for store/retreive attributes as PDLs.

2010-04-27 18:24  cerney

	* hdf5.pd, HDF5/Dataset.pm: Updated to include capability to
	store/retreive attributes as PDLs. Thanks to a patch from Xavier
	Calbet.

2009-02-06 15:02  cerney

	* HDF5/Dataset.pm, t/total.t: Updated so integer (PDL_Long) works
	with 64-bit machines. Previously 64 bit machines would crash
	retreiving 32-bit data, because it was mapped to NATIVE_LONG, which
	the h5 library thinks is 64bit for 64bit machines.

2007-03-12 07:56  cerney

	* HDF5/Dataset.pm, t/total.t: Updated the dataset hyperslab
	retreive interface to use the start/end coords instead of the
	start/lengh coord. (From Xavier Calbet's updated patch)

2007-03-07 07:54  cerney

	* hdf5.pd, HDF5/Dataset.pm, t/total.t: Added capability to get
	hyperslabs of the arrays stored in the file. (Thans to path from
	Xavier Calbet).

2007-01-29 07:05  A0182636

	* hdf5.pd: Updated link to the hdf homepage.

	* COPYRIGHT, README, hdf5.pd: Preparation for next release.

2006-01-10 12:57  A0182636

	* HDF5/Dataset.pm: Updated to preallocate the data for an array
	incrementally, rather than all at once. On win32 allocating all at
	once causes perl to hang when reading large arrays (> 50Meg)

2004-07-02 12:02  cerney

	* HDF5/Dataset.pm: Fixed bug where Dataset $self variables weren't
	declared lexical. This could cause the hdf5 objects to hang around
	longer than they should.

	* hdf5.pd, t/ztotal_index.t: Modified BuildGroupIndex to build the
	index for all groups, even if some of the groups don't have all the
	attributes defined.

	5.6. Fixed problem with objects getting destroyed before they
	should. Made member data between the helper objects more consistent

2001-04-06 22:35  cerney

	* HDF5/: Dataset.pm, Group.pm: Fixed calling of close functions in
	the object DESTROYS. This creates problems elsewhere, not fixed
	yet.

2001-04-06 16:30  cerney

	* hdf5.pd, t/total_index.t: Modified syntax to work with perl 5.6

	* hdf5.pd, HDF5/Group.pm, t/total_index.t: Changed the way groups

	apply to lower-level groups. This is consistent with the hierarchy
	of HDF5 files.
